Here I am going to gather all data that I believe to be relavant to the depressionary cycle that we are now entering and attempt to find statiscally significant relationships
between amoungst the seleceted data. This is all in the hope of developing a novel insight which could be of some use to the current situation. I will update this description as I go along. 

This is a personal project and is not part of an educational course.
